from qmat.lagrange import LagrangeApproximation

### TODOs:
### 1. needs to be adapted to deal with (mini-)batches -> einsum, compare to Fourier layer and adapt
### 2. for training requires autodiff of the qmat stuff? needs to be tested
### 3. the switching between numpy and torch is stupid. Do everything in torch
### 4. implementation is for 2d, needs to be generalized
