# Investigate Dedalus simulation for RBC 2D

- [convRuns.py](./convRuns.py) : script used to determine critical Rayleigh for one given space grid
- [sdcRuns.py](./sdcRuns.py) : script used to run SDC with different time-step size (convergence plots)
- [perfo](./perfo/) : base script to plot some performance measurements for parallel run of Dedalus-SDC on JUSUF
