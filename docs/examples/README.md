# Neural Operators for learning of PDEs

This repository contains first implementation of [Fourier Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895)


## Requirements
The code is based on python 3 (version 3.11) and the packages required can be installed with

	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data

This code base focuses on the Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection (RBC) problem, as a starting point wave equation and darcy flow is solved using the data downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/10406879 (~2.4GB). It covers instances of the Poisson, Wave, Navier-Stokes, Allen-Cahn, Transport and Compressible Euler equations and Darcy flow. 

Run the script `download_cno_data.py` which downloads all required data into the appropriate folder (it requires 'wget' to be installed on your system).

For RBC problem the data is generated using [Dedalus](https://dedalus-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/examples/ivp_2d_rayleigh_benard.html)

## Model Training

To run on JUWELS booster use [submit_juwels.sbatch.sh](./submit_juwels.sbatch.sh) file that activates the python virtual environment and loads the required modules using [setup.sh](../setup.sh) and executes the  [train_FNO.py](./train_FNO.py) file.

[DarcyWave.ipynb](./DarcyWave.ipynb) and [RBC.ipynb](./RBC.ipynb) jupyter notebook is also available.


## Note

Training can be done using CPU or a single GPU.

GPU testing done on JUWELS Booster: 1X NVIDIA A100 (40GB) GPU with:
- GCC-12.3.0 
- OpenMPI-4.1.5 
- CUDA-12
